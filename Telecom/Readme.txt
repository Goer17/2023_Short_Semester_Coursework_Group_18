This code is for our robot to move smoothly.
There are five main parts in our code.
Sensor module: Use ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance before, left and right.
Motion module: It is mainly used to control the rotation of the wheel of the car.
LCD module: It is used to display the real-time data of three ultrasonic waves and the motion state of the car.
WI-FI module: It is used to link to the camera and can connect to the image recognition of the IOT via Wi-Fi.
Servo module: Control the number of degrees the camera turns left and right and up and down.
Please see the code for the functions of specific functions
